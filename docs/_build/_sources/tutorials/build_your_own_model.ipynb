The [detailed examples](https://arxiv.org/help/api/user-manual#detailed_examples) below illustrate how to do this in a variety of languages. Because of speed limitations in our implementation of the API, the maximum number of results returned from a single call (max_results) is limited to 30000 in slices of at most 2000 at a time, using the max_results and start query parameters. For example to retrieve matches 6001-8000: http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=all:electron&start=6000&max_results=8000\n",

    ">    Large result sets put considerable load on the server and also take a long time to render. We recommend to refine queries which return more than 1,000 results, or at least request smaller slices. For bulk metadata harvesting or set information, etc., the [OAI-PMH](https://arxiv.org/help/oa/index) interface is more suitable. A request with max_results >30,000 will result in an HTTP 400 error code with appropriate explanation. A request for 30000 results will typically take a little over 2 minutes to return a response of over 15MB. Requests for fewer results are much faster and correspondingly smaller.\n",

The dark matter accretion histories of galaxies have remarkably self-similar PSDs and are coherent with the in-situ star formation on timescales $>3$ Gyr. There is considerable diversity among the different models in their (i) power due to SFR variability at a given timescale, (ii) amount of correlation with adjacent timescales (PSD slope), (iii) evolution of median PSDs with stellar mass, and (iv) presence and locations of breaks in the PSDs. The PSD framework is a useful space to study the SFHs of galaxies since model predictions vary widely.\n",
